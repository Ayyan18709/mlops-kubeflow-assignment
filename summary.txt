MLOps Kubeflow Assignment - Project Summary
============================================

Project Overview:
-----------------
This project implements an end-to-end MLOps pipeline using MLflow for experiment tracking and 
model management, DVC for data versioning, and Jenkins for CI/CD automation. The pipeline 
performs data extraction, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation on a housing price 
prediction dataset.

What We Accomplished:
---------------------

1. PIPELINE COMPONENTS (Task 2)
   - Created src/pipeline_components.py with four main functions:
     * data_extraction(): Fetches versioned data from DVC remote (with fallback to existing data)
     * data_preprocessing(): Handles data cleaning, scaling, and train/test splitting
     * model_training(): Trains a Random Forest Regressor with MLflow tracking
     * model_evaluation(): Evaluates model performance and logs metrics
   
   - All components use MLflow for experiment tracking with nested runs
   - Components handle the MEDHOUSEVAL target column from the California housing dataset

2. PIPELINE ORCHESTRATION (Task 3 - Modified)
   - Originally planned for Kubeflow Pipelines, but switched to MLflow due to Kubeflow issues
   - Created main.py as the orchestration script that:
     * Accepts command-line arguments (--dvc_url, --n_estimators, --test_size)
     * Runs all pipeline steps sequentially
     * Logs everything to MLflow experiment "MLOps_Assignment_Flow"
   
   - Successfully executed pipeline with results:
     * MSE: 0.255
     * R2 Score: 0.805

3. CI/CD WITH JENKINS (Task 4)
   - Created Jenkinsfile with three stages:
     * Stage 1: Environment Setup (venv creation, dependency installation)
     * Stage 2: Pipeline Execution (runs main.py)
     * Stage 3: Verify Artifacts (checks models/ and metrics/ directories)
   
   - Simulated Jenkins pipeline locally with successful execution of all stages
   - Pipeline archives model.pkl and metrics.json as artifacts

4. DOCUMENTATION (Task 5)
   - Created comprehensive README.md with:
     * Project overview
     * Setup instructions for MLflow and DVC
     * Pipeline walkthrough with commands
     * CI/CD information
   
   - All code pushed to repository with proper structure

Key Files Created/Modified:
---------------------------
- src/pipeline_components.py: Core pipeline functions with MLflow integration
- main.py: Pipeline orchestration script
- Jenkinsfile: CI/CD pipeline definition
- README.md: Complete project documentation
- requirements.txt: Python dependencies (kfp, pandas, scikit-learn, dvc, mlflow, etc.)
- summary.txt: This file

Generated Artifacts:
--------------------
- models/model.pkl: Trained Random Forest model (144.7 MB)
- metrics/metrics.json: Model evaluation metrics
- mlruns/: MLflow experiment tracking data
- processed/: Preprocessed train/test datasets

Technology Stack:
-----------------
- MLflow: Experiment tracking and model management
- DVC: Data version control
- Jenkins: CI/CD automation
- scikit-learn: Machine learning (Random Forest Regressor)
- pandas: Data manipulation
- Python 3.13

Verification Results:
---------------------
✓ Pipeline executes successfully end-to-end
✓ Model training completes with good performance (R2: 0.805)
✓ MLflow UI accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000
✓ All artifacts generated correctly
✓ Jenkins pipeline stages simulate successfully
✓ Code is well-documented and reproducible

Notes:
------
- DVC executable not found in PATH, but pipeline uses existing data successfully
- MLflow filesystem tracking backend used (warning about deprecation, but functional)
- Pipeline designed to be flexible with command-line parameters
- All components use nested MLflow runs for better organization
